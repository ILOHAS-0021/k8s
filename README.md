### Caution ###

- The script files were designed based on ***Ubuntu 20.04*** version and assuming that ***Docker*** is ***pre-installed***.

- If Docker is not installed, uncomment the Docker installation command in the ***setup-k8s.sh*** script.

- If problems occur when running the ***master-k8s.sh*** script, run the `docker login` command.
